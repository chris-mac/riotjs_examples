# riotjs_examples

This project includes some basic code examples of how to use RiotJS.

We start with a basic project using a node server running on port 3000, express for routing and swig for Node templating

To get started


- clone the repo
- npm install
- node app.js
- visit {my__ip}:3000/{my_example_url}

I have tried to keep clean separation between tags so we can introduce gradual complexity, each tag demonstrating only one new core principle

Each of the pages are verbosely but semantically named, the order of examples is below:-

page: basic_tag_with_runtime_compilation.html tag: basic_tag.tag
page: tag_with_css_runtime_compilation.html tag: tag-withcss.tag
page: tag_with_object_runtime_compilation.html tag: tag-withobject.tag
